The following two lines\nof code reorder family advantage and mom IQ to make the visualisation follow\na logical order (from low to high). The visualisation code displays the children’s\ntest scores as points, whilst adding a regression line on top to show how the\nrelationship between test scores and IQ vary across backgrounds. Surprising cases\nare coloured differently.\nThe figure shows that there is a positive relationship between mother’s IQ and\nchild’s test score across all backgrounds. This means that children of mothers with\nhigher IQ scores are more likely to test highly. This relationship is strongest\nin those with low familial advantage. The other two groups have more surprising\ncases (when the predicted relationship is not found) than low familial advantage\nbut this may be due to them having larger sample sizes.\nLink to repository\nhttps://github.com/martha-png/GV300-Assignment\n\n\n\n",
